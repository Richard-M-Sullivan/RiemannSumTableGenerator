# RiemannSumTableGenerator
generates a table that helps with calculating the definite integral of a function using a Riemann Sum.

RiemannSumTableGenerator.py is the main application that you should use.

RiemannSumCalculatorSharableNotebook was just created so I could share it online with people who would not know how to install things.
(the idea was that they could use nbviewer in order to run it without needing to use the terminal)
